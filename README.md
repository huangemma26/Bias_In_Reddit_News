# Bias in Reddit World News

This project shows that bias exists in the news that Reddit users recieve. The model was built using linear regression and NLP. It shows that some terms, such as America, Russia, and Trump, can lead to a disproportionate amount of upvotes or downvotes on an article. These articles will then gain more visibility.  

Included in this repository are:

* **Project_2_Powerpoint.pdf** -- Powerpoint overview of the project
* **Web_Scraper.ipynb** -- Notebook containing the web scraper used to obtain the data
* **Clean_and_Regress.ipynb** -- Notebook containing the model and modeling process
